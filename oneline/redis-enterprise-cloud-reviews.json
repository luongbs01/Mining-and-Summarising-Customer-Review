We needed a session storage solution that would be extremely fast and reliable as well as incorporate into our current technology stack well. Redis Cloud hits on all of those points and has been a very good solution for us. We use Redis Cloud for our primary Redis instances that power our website and apps. Redis Cloud has met our needs and has made development and deployment of our apps easy and reliable.
