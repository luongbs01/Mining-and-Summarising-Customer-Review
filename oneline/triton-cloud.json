{"name":"Triton Cloud","oneline":"Pros 1. Very efficient software, easy to deploy and no need to install on your device. 2. Multi-cloud kubernetes management , a unified set of kubernetes clusters across 4 different public clouds, and it is quite simple  to deploy an app to environments managed by this multi-cloud K8s solution. 3. Scalability is great, given that technology keeps changing and data keeps adding. Cons. 1. Missing a lot of plugins. 2. Some docker features also not available.Triton cloud is a good infrastructure to host servers. Its model with Kubernetes is a good pluggable model. It gives a tough competition to other famous infrastructures with its capability of default VMs and Kubernetes. this product is awesome for any company to improve their cloud related things like storage and many services very easily and it is very easy to access. What a great private cloud computing service. Integration is so simple and easy and very, very fast. Were using it as a giant data center with a ton of different containers inside. Security is also done very well and we don't worry about security now because of it."}
