Valuable services. Sometimes hard to reach. Good geographical footprint of services. Easy to use and to customize. The web service for managing virtual machines and network would benefit with more features. It is a flexible platform with a very qualified help desk team. Must improve response time to incidents. One of the best things is the unlimited bandwith between datacenters of different countries. Interoute is a very good partner for virtualization and colocation but its SaS solutions are poor nowadays."}
