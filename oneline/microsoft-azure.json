Microsoft Azure is a great platform for a startup to a full-fledged business that wants to deploy their apps and infrastructure to the cloud or just to increase their market presence by going online.  We used Microsoft Azure for the VM instances and CI/CD DevOps.  We also used Azure to deploy our VPN but had to transfer it to other providers like AWS for pricing and scalability.  Using Azure for high bandwidth use case scenario is for me just a waste of money as the data transfer fees are way too high, we got a bill of $3000+ for just the bandwidth, and was still higher than all the Instances and SQL servers cost running combined. Our company (200+) recently transitioned over to [Microsoft] Azure to alleviate the \"clutter\".  We were outsourcing various functions, causing confusion and conflict.  Having changed over to 1 concise platform containing all of our needs, has cleared the bottleneck we have been fighting for years.  It has been a smooth transition as well with minimal to zero impact. At our organisation we are using Microsoft Azure for hosting the website and storage purposes.  We are using Compute engine for running the website.  We love to use it because of up time.  There is near to zero downtime in that service and it provides good analytical support so we can get the compute, memory and bandwidth usage. We have been using Microsoft Azure to automate the process.  And to work in the cloud Azure is one of the most secure and support cloud.  We use to save data for out clients, to manage processes, we can integrate with other programs and it is intuitive to use.  Microsoft gives us all that we could ask for in a technological company. We use [Microsoft] Azure internally for some applications as well as help clients implement Azure solutions of various sizes and configurations within their organization.  We also use [Microsoft] Azure as a \"test environment\" to try out some of the latest cloud / IoT products as a means of better informing future clients on what will work best for them. We provisioned/synchronized users and managed user lifecycle in Azure to help organizations utilize Microsoft’s cloud portfolio of applications and services. Azure is Microsoft's equivalent to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, etc.  From a technical perspective, these providers are largely interchangeable in my experience.  We primarily used Azure Compute, which let us spin up VMs in the cloud, to host our production and developmentKubernetesclusters.  We also used Azure VMs to host our production database -MongoDB. Microsoft Azure is being used across the entire organization at this time.  It is being customized for use with individual departments.  We use it at my non-profit and I also operate it at a large, regional, mid-western electric and gas utility. [Microsoft] Azure has allowed us to quickly and reliably connect to information across our network in a seamless fashion.  We are able to share links and data very quickly.  It also allows us the advantage to use PowerBI to access data from many different departments because they are all in one place. The whole organization uses Microsoft Azure for various reasons.  The main reason is to run our product in the service fabric environment.  The other reasons include creating virtual machines, classic cloud service, and SQL databases.  Microsoft Azure helps us to avoid having physical servers [in] the environment which are high in maintenance. Our company used Azure for the launch of the process automation platform.  We later added a number of complementary services i. e.  authentication, storage, telemetry, monitoring, Azure SQL and PowerBI.  While this virtual platform was supported by a small team, it supported the whole organization.  Our Azure stack was used as a virtual infrastructure in the IaaS and SaaS capacities. [Microsoft] Azure has a large amount of services and capabilities, but we're using it primarily for Identity (Azure Active Directory), Networking (Application Gateways, ExpressRoute), as well as some basic Compute (Virtual Machines) and some web and storage.  Also, as big Office 365 customers, we use [Microsoft] Azure in conjunction with some of these services such as storage (backups) and some media services (videos).  Additionally, some Azure AI and security services are used in conjunction with some of the O365 services for DLP (digital loss protection) and other security services.  Of course, we also use the Azure Portal to manage all of this.  All in all it is a very nice and integrated (and expandable) solution for a total and cohesive set of common business problems like we just described.  We flat out could not do much of what we do now without Azure AD (MUCH better than on-premises Active Directory).  There are some learning curves and potentially some cost barriers, but again, since the \"total\" Azure solution can be implemented in parts and expand as needed, it still makes an excellent way to address immediate problems (whatever you feel is most important) while simultaneously positioning your business to succeed in the future as you are able to add on services and shift older legacy solutions to the cloud. We're using Microsft Azure services on multiple regions from our organization and for several types of workloads.  It is our current Global standard for Cloud usage, following a global contract with Microsoft.  In my region, we're using Computing services (running some Dev/PreProd environments on Azure).  We also recently migrated Windows 2008 servers from legacy applications to Azure, in order to keep extended support.  We're also using Storage Accounts both for Data archiving (through 3rd party Archiving tools) and Backup to Cloud. As with many companies, it is addressing the 'elastic' demands, specially for Dev/PreProd environments. . .  Many times we need to deploy temporary environments for some applications and we don't have enough time to purchase an expansion on our OnPrem environment.  Cloud is a great escape for this situation. Also, It addresses the need of retaining Archived files and Backups for long term.  We were able to bring great savings with Data Archiving solution in place today. Our organization is spread across the globe.  Putting our servers in Azure has enabled us to offer high availability to our customers and development department. Azure is one of the leading hyper scalers having 54 regions globally today as of writing this comment.  They provide scalable compute, network, storage and other functionality helping organizations to scale and grow their businesses rapidly.  As a Senior Solutions Architect helping many small to large enterprises to embark on their cloud transformation journey, I have personally noticed the growing preference for Azure as a choice of platform. Microsoft Azure provides seamless data access on the cloud.  Currently in our organization this is being used department wide.  We are using this for hosting our applications on virtual machines and managing the same on the cloud.  As well for data storage purposes. \nPlatform hosting and resources availability is excellent.  It's highly secure and infrastructure recovery is pretty fast and seamless.  Large scale data storage is no longer an issue.  Virtual machines availability is pretty cool. Previously we were using an in-house server and multiple systems by uploading multiple operating systems.  Now, we have eliminated the cost of an in-premise server and multiple systems by deploying multiple operating Linux servers over the Azure cloud and SQL server as well as well over cloud. Azure is being used in many aspects of our organization.  It is being used across all departments of the organization.  It helps address the seamless scale-out of our growing infrastructure needs. I have used Microsoft Azure previously to run some machine learning algorithms that processed a large amount of data and made predictions.  This allowed us to improve someone's performance. We use our Azure storage accounts for blob storage and SMB shares.  They don't work on all ISP providers or hotspots.  They work on Verizon fiber and cellular hotspots but not one of our local ISPs.  We use the SQL server and database services.  I really like how easy it is to scale them up and down, live. We also have a website app meant for internal use and use the SendGrid account connector.  It is really nice to have easy white-listing for everything: websites, databases, etc.  that we can trust.  We host everything here instead of making servers VPN into our office. Additionally, we have a site-to-site VPN between our offices and Azure.  That works well and enabled us to turn off much of our public access. We use the built-in VM backup tools and those have been really easy to use right there on Azure.  Also, the snapshots automatically built into databases we have used several times.  It creates a new database from a snapshot from every few hours from up to almost 30 days ago and then you just copy over whatever data you need. . Microsoft Azure is being deployed using Azure stack on top of cloud services in an on-premise environment setup in our organization.  It is prominently operated by our IT department to provide on-demand scalable platform solution to be used by support and business units.  Main users in the organization are product departments who are responsible to deliver digital services and data monetization business units. We are using Microsoft Azure as one of our primary cloud providers and we've offloaded several of our production workloads to it.  We are a heavy user of storage accounts as well as function apps.  It helps us quickly roll out projects to production where we can innovate and experiment. Microsoft Azure is one of the best IaaS cloud platforms that we have used ever.  You can quickly set up most Windows server applications with a high availability.  My experience with Azure is overall good and would definitely recommend this to others.  Microsoft has a very responsible customer support. We use it for spinning up virtual environments and hosting software for clients.  We use cold and hot storage for client's servers and backups with Azure as they offer some of the best storage rates as compared to AWS.  We can also spin up virtual domain and active directories for our clients to remove the heat and maintenance from small facilities on the edge of their environment that might not have a dedicated space for IT.  This allows us to offsite not only IT but also the infrastructure. Microsoft Azure is being used across the entire organization at this time.  It is being customized for use with individual departments.  We use it at my non-profit and I also operate it at a large, regional, mid-western electric and gas utility. Azure has allowed us to quickly and reliably connect to information across our network in a seamless fashion.  We are able to share links and data very quickly.  It also allows us the advantage to use PowerBI to access data from many different departments because they are all in one place. [It's being used] Across a specific department; allows us to model data and to carry out a selection of machine learning tasks around data from our reports. Microsoft Azure has been our platform of choice since 2015.  We initially implemented a backup solution but grew into the environment as we required more and more resources.  Now we take advantage of the ecosystem consisting of websites, SQL servers, virtual machines just to name a few. Microsoft Azure provides reasonable pricing and even deeper global infrastructure.  We don`t know an alternative with similar benefits.  The implementation team is very supportive and responsible, easy to contact and gives a fast reaction.  It offers the availability of so many services, like web apps, VMs, CDN, SQL servers, good storage options, etc.  It's a good service and we use it daily. We use Azure across our entire business and it solves all of our infrastructure and hosting needs.  We use it for:1) Software development: We build software using App Services, AKS, Azure Functions, Event Grid, Sql Server2) Running our internal programs: We use Logic apps and AKS to run our custom production apps. 3) Hosting SaaS products for our customers: We build products for our customers and run them in AKS and monitor using Microsoft Azure monitor / app insights. We use Microsoft Azure both divisionally and corporately.  We have a partner-agreement with Microsoft and a significant investment in order to migrate as much of our server infrastructure into the cloud as we can.  This allows us to be more flexible in hiring since servers a not on-prem and location-based, and given us access to tools we never had before.  The centralized billing is a huge asset. We use Azure to host our SaaS financial healthcare application built on asp. net MVC + SQL + ESB architecture.  We currently use base IaaS, Azure SQL, Azure web apps, load balancers, and analytics.  We migrated to Azure from a small cloud vendor for flexibility, cost savings and ease of meeting various security requirements. Azure is used for our farm of servers.  It enables us to have servers up 24/7 without any interruptions.  We can upgrade CPU/RAM on the fly as needs come up. We use Microsoft Azure for our application hosting.  Earlier we had a thirty party vendor which took care of our hosting.  Later on, we explored and found out that Microsoft Azure was a very good option for our cloud.  Gradually we moved almost all of our applications to Azure by end of 2018.  We have different flavors like Web-apps, API Apps, Azure functions and Azure VM as well.  As mentioned earlier we have on-premise thirty party hosting now that we have moved to being self-controlled by using Azure Cloud. I was using Microsoft Azure as a part of the hybrid infrastructure.  Part of our services were stored on-premise and lots of them were based on Microsoft Azure platform.  A few that we used were Microsoft Azure Active Directory services, virtualization services, all the cross-connected with Office 365 services.  Plus I had experience with a fully cloud-based Microsoft infrastructure with VPN tunnels from the local network to Microsoft Azure services. As a marketing services provider, we have lots of legacy applications that were built atop the . NET framework.  As we expanded to offer cloud services to better serve our clients, we decided to go with Microsoft Azure as the PAAS partner.  Not only does it allow us to use Microsoft servers in the backend but also Linux as part of our backend infrastructure.  We use SQL Database servers for our data layer and it was an easy choice for us to leverage Microsoft Azure as the common platform. Microsoft Azure is used by departments to manage larger data sets across entities.  The software addresses the need for multiple users to have access to multiple different data sets simultaneously.  The software makes this relatively easy by making Microsoft Azure similar to the user-friendliness of other Microsoft products.  Users point their analytical tools at Azure for data visualization and analytics.  Some analytics is also done in Azure itself. We are currently using Microsoft Azure across the whole organization.  However department by department are choosing what functions to utilize or not.  Some of the main functions we are using are Dev Ops for code storage and continuous integration, Power BI, Data Lake and reporting functions, SQL, IIS, App services and more are also in use across the organization. We use select Microsoft Azure products and APIs to complete some of our more machine learning-oriented tasks off-premise.  This includes modeling data we receive from magnetometer sensors, recognizing environmental effects in data during hardware testing, and some other backend-related tasks like modeling traffic and parking behavior.  Using these products allows us to move tasks that require lots of processing power to cloud products that are optimized for this purpose. At our financial institution, we are currently using Microsoft Azure to deploy thin client applications and web services, and provide access to SQL databases.  The usage of this great tool is mainly throughout our IT department.  Other areas of the organization do not need to have access to the administration portion of the console.  It has greatly helped us deploy applications and web based services in a centralized cloud environment. We are using Azure for our research on Learning Analytics for the University.  For now, it is being by only a department but we plan to deploy it in other departments as well.  We are mostly using ElasticSearch and Machine Learning service since we need it for our predictive analysis and prescriptive analysis and also trying to use for our apps. Its been used at an organizational level.  We used the trial pack to evaluate Azure. It has addressed many issues.  Compared to other cloud service providers, the Azure Management Console is far simpler to monitor.  Since we migrated our server to Azure haven't faced any downtime.  The second point is that Azure SQL as a Service has helped to optimize the cost and increase performance. The response time of Azure customer service is amazing; I would usually get a callback from them within three hours. For cloud deployment, for continuous integration.  Saving TCO of IT infrastructure, reduce business downtime.  Having satisfied customers.  Azure is a reliable cloud service for whom would like to achieve 0 downtimes.  We are going to explore what Azure can do on Machine Learning and AI for the trading platform and predict the business impact. One of the great benefits of any cloud based computer is the fact that you don't need to maintain your own hardware.  No need to think about updates.  No need to worry about disaster striking at the hardware level.  No need for your own dedicated IT crew.  Just sit back and enjoy the computers which are maintained by Microsoft themselves. We use Microsoft Azure services for our apps team.  We build dev/testing servers; server provisioning is very easy and quick. Azure is currently being used by the research & development department for things such as ElasticSearch and Cortana Analytics to add into our applications.  Our managed services team is also using Azure for Application Insights - an application monitoring system which tracks usage of our application.  Our migration team uses Azure for hardware resources, spinning up multiple server instances to complete migrations. Microsoft Azure is implemented across in bits and pieces.  It is mainly driven to save operational costs for non production workloads thereby reducing the requirement of physical hardware in the data center. I have used for my academic project and then my previous company.  So my intention is just to learn. Benefits are: Only need to deploy the application and the rest is a Microsoft managed, hassle free environment.  No need to worry about your Windows patching and updates; server running out of space, technical troubleshooting and maintenance cost.  Time is saved in building up the servers and hardware non-utilization has been eliminated. We use Microsoft Azure in our organization but I work for implementing Azure services and replatforming and Migrating application to Azure at our clients.  It solves various problems from easily deploying application to production, reducing overhead of infrastructure cost and its management.  It speeds up deployment, operation and scalability.  Azure has data centers all across the globe and is one of the leading player in having the most number of data centers around the globe, so it helps users' data to be easily reachable with less cost and overheads.  So data is presented to the user from within the region where he resides or requests for.  Azure has a fully integrated development environment making it easy for developer to the tools and development services.  It has an integrated IOT platform and IOT is the next big thing in IT world.  Azure provides Agility and gives developers, Architects, and Consultants an easy to use service required for applications.  Azure also helps with DevOps; it has a fully integrated pipeline which gives DevOps Capabilities implementing CI/CD.  Azure also helps in disaster recovery.  We can also achieve High Availability due to Azure presence all over the globe.  Azure is complaint so for example finance companies can rely on Azure to do the heavy lifting of data back and forth from on prim data centers to cloud.  Using most of the capabilities of Azure, it is helping us implementing scalable and reliable solution at clients and at different organizations. Currently, our department is using Microsoft Azure as an extension of our private cloud.  We are a public university and we have difficulties in buying hardware to expand our infrastructure.  We use a public cloud as part of the process of having temporary expansion until the end of the buying process.  We offer researchers an IaaS cloud and for now, we also use Microsoft Azure to host applications developed for PaaS clouds. We are only just starting with our use of Azure.  We started with some pilot initiatives and are looking at ways in which we can use it more extensively.  Some of the pilots have been successful, others less so.  Mobility seems to be a big driver, but also some of the difficult scenarios around product licensing are made better in the cloud. It is used across the IT department.  We deploy all . NET based applications in Azure environment. It's being used across the whole organization via Active Directory, but our primary use is for hosting our websites.  It provides a lot of customizability and functionality that most web hosts don't offer, and it gives us the flexibility that we need, with a great balance of performance and price.  It's pretty bleeding edge and they provide solutions for pretty much anything you can think of through their marketplace.  Highly recommended. Microsoft Azure has served a need with our company in being able to provide a scalable platform for our customers to be able to host managed services applications.  Azure allows for predictable billing, placing resources in the right geographical location, and instant scaling for when we need to provide more horsepower for processing high volume blips. We are using Azure to host our mortgage application. The reason to choose Azure was:a) We can't afford to have any downtime of our applicationb) At any point of time, user should need feel that application is behaving slow. c) We would like to focus more on our line of business application instead of investing time in monitoring and deployment. The Windows Azure platform was used to host several web services for a marketing and software development company I worked for.  Azure's scalability allowed the company to move away from several hosting providers to a single cloud hosting infrastructure.  The major problem with Azure was replicating specific legacy environments for some projects. Azure is being used org wide on different initiatives.  We are an MS premier account and they have made it very attractive for us both financially and via support to build both our internal and client-facing applications there. Currently we have started migrating some of our aging in-house servers to being hosted in Azure.  This allows us to save on the cost of new hardware, licenses, and maintenance of having these servers physically hosted on site.  With Windows Server 2003 going end of life this past year we realized we needed to upgrade or replace a bunch of our servers and we were looking at a substantial investment in new hardware and licenses.  Azure allowed us to get around a lot of those issues, plus allowed us to gain some cloud replication for DR purposes. We use Azure services for our entire company.  We have many users who are remote and it is a terrific way to collaborate.  We love that we only have to pay for the capacity that we are actually using instead of having a rack of servers that aren't always being tapped, but are always running.  It also saves on the costs of real estate for the server room and additional money that would have to be spent to upgrade and update the servers. Windows Azure was used (by the previous organization that I was at) for emails and also for engineering development purposes.  The business problem was to work on developing a software solution that would run in the Azure cloud. Internally, we have Ubuntu and Windows virtual machines deployed on Azure that support our hosting and internal application services (likeJIRAand Confluence).  We also use it for a variety of storage services.  This helps us keep equipment costs at an overall minimum when compared to other hosting and virtual machine services. We implement a cloud management platform and Windows Azure is one of the many cloud providers we integrate with.  We deploy custom workloads to be provisioned which also integrate with configuration management solutions such as Puppet.  It is used within our department only for testing and our clients use it for development workloads. It has been used across the whole organization. Our Consulting Firm uses Azure for clients on specific projects.  Azure is an excellent Cloud solution that helps offset the cost of development by allowing rapid setup and deployment.  It also help provide enterprise cloud solutions.  As we work with companies to develop new ideas and better infrastructure cloud is often an excellent choice to improve quality and mobile access in particular. Windows Azure is being used by numerous departments in our organization.  It is being used in many different forms.  It is used as a data transport between clients and as service apps for teams.  It is also being used as a Virtual Private Network and to implement Single Sign On. We were looking to expand our operations adding new functionality which would cause tremendous strain on our existing servers.  The web and worker roles were the perfect solution, allowing us to develop a front end application tied to SQL Azure and an Azure Service bus which would relay data and messages to the back end worker role.  The processing jobs could take over 10 hours of hard computing, so off loading this work was imperative.  Azure gave us an inexpensive, robust, and immediately scalable solution to make this happen. We use Windows Azure for several customer facing websites, as well as our internal users. Our whole organization uses Azure.  We have set it up to automate the build of test environments for deploying code for clients as well as set up instances of our infrastructure on the cloud.  Azure has also become part of our DR plan as it is a great place to restore cloud backups of critical infrastructure VMs and get back up and running very quickly.  Our developers love it, our Infrastructure consultants love it, our organization is having a ball with it.  Prices are also very competitive as it is cheaper than Amazon. We moved our entire SCM4Good platform and the SCM4Hunger Warehouse Management module to the Microsoft Azure Cloud.  This provides important gains in performance, reliability, and redundancy.  In particular, Microsoft’s Content Delivery Network, with nodes in more than 16 countries worldwide, closes the distance for many of our developing country users in terms of Internet geography, and has given noticeable response-time improvements.  Nathan Au, Project Manager for FareShare Brighton and Hove noted: “We use Aidmatrix’ SCM4Hunger to help receive, warehouse and dispatch food to our hunger agencies every day.  We know we run high transaction volumes, especially during peak times each week.  When Aidmatrix moved to the Microsoft Azure Cloud it was like night and day for us.  We saw dramatic performance improvement in response times on average of 4x faster, in some situations it went as high as 10x.  It’s amazing what a difference running the same application on the Azure Cloud can make.  Now we can focus that much more time on getting food to those who are hungry. ”. Windows Azure is being used to host a QR Code application in the cloud. Looking at lower costs alternatives to maintaining our own data center assets for our commercial buisness applications. We currently use Windows Azure to support a client's new business intake and support infrastructure.  Right now, just the development team is directly working with Azure, but many members of the client are using the products we've developed in Azure.  The new system we have developed is replacing a VB6 legacy app that will eventually be phased out. We currently use Azure internally at our organization as well as provide implementation services for other companies.  It is a great solution to extend your datacenter out to the cloud and spin up infrastructure as demand increases without investing in the hardware, software and technical skills normally needed for on-prem infrastructure. Windows Azure is a product that helps us quickly and easily deploy various products.  Anything from IaaS to SaaS to PaaS products are all used and Azure is always in the mix as it provides a secure and effective way of provisioning the necessary technology.  Whenever we think of a new project we think of Azure in the realm of possibilities. I used Azure Websites for my service's ASP. Net MVC website.  I published the website from Visual Studio 2012 & 2013 and it worked like a charm. I used an Azure SQL Database for the website's membership (login) data.  Again, worked great. I configured the SQL Database for weekly automatic export to an Azure Storage account for backup purposes.  The export ran without issue 99. 999% of the time.  There were a couple instances, over the course of a couple years, in which the export failed and I received an email to this effect.  In these cases, I went into the Azure portal and reran the export manually. I used Azure Service Bus Queues to queue email jobs.  Email jobs were generated by the website when users used a \"send invitation\" function to email an invite to friends.  Email jobs were also generated by a separate back end process that ran on-premises, and not on Azure.  Another on-premises back end process pulled the email jobs from the Azure Service Bus queue and sent out the emails.  The Azure Service Bus queue worked great and was very solid.  The Service Bus Queue API used to enqueue and dequeue jobs took a little time to understand, but beyond the learning curve, I had no problems with it.  Very solid. I would highly recommend Azure.  Besides the solid performance of the services that I used, they are constantly pushing prices down, evolving the existing services, and rolling out new services.  New announcements of lower prices and service improvements come nearly every two weeks.  It is a very impressive operation, top to bottom, from the physical data centers to the website portal that you use to interact and configure your services. Windows Azure is being used as a vehicle for implementing Function as a Service in various capacities.  We find that this is an excellent vehicle to implement single purpose functions (both from a cost and simplicity standpoint) that can then be scaled up and out.  We are currently using this model to integrate between an on premise PeopleSoft installation with a mobile platform for work order management and related activities.  We find that this provides the field users better and accurate up to date information compared to a timed push model. "}
