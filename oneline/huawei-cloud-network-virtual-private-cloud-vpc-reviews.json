{"name":"Huawei Cloud Network Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)","oneline":"This was implemented for one of our clients. Initially, we suggested a different platform but then, we came to know that they already had that platform and were experiencing some issues with it, so they wanted to switch. They wanted something with strong accessibility applications from distinct geographical zones. So we suggested this since it has one of the best networks in the industry. You can construct private, isolated virtual networks using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). In a VPC, you can assign Elastic IP (EIP) addresses, establish IP address ranges, subnets, and security groups, and allot bandwidth. On the cloud, private networks are totally segregated. In the same VPC, you can create ECSs in multiple availability zones. Self-service network administration frees you from normal network setups and allows you to install your network in a more flexible way. Use the VPC service to create private networks, and ELB to provide web services that can be accessed by a large number of users at the same time. Supports two-way user service and data migration, as well as user service and data availability at both sites. It gives us full control of all networking systems across our organizations improving security to our data. We have been able to set up virtual network system that reflects all data that enters into our organization and analytics produced from each analysis. Planning of our programs is based on the reporting of data on daily programs and the performance of each department based on predictive intelligence provided."}
