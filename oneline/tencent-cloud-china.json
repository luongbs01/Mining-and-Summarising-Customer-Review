{"name":"Tencent Cloud - China","oneline":"Highly trusted service provider. They have aggressive competitive pricing compared to competitors. They have a very responsive cloud, and satisfied with services provided. Especially great for large companies with many employees and many users using the cloud at once. Easy and the best trusted cloud provider within China.We have a very close relationship and things are running smoothly. There was some features/issues needed here and there that could have been addressed perhaps quickly in my sense, but overall it is alright.The storage is very big. The service is reliable. The upload and download speed is a little bit slow.The CDN bandwidth , the quality live streaming service Satisfied our need.But some other field are also not so matual, need some coorperation  to upgrade them.Account registration was straight-forward and configuration and set-up of our virtual servers was easy and intuitive."}
