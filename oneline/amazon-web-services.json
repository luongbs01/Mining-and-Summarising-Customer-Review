The information technology department implements AWS to help support a variety of different issues and programs and allows us to maintain an effective and efficient service so that our business can perform as needed and allows us to better support our end-users. I have been using Amazon Web Services for more than 3 years as of now.  Its one of the best cloud computing platform, which has wide range of functionalities (services from Servers to ML, AI stuff) and the best part is all these services are provided in competitive pricing, also UI for the services is easy to understand and it has wide community following. We use AWS for our website content distribution network (CDN) as well as hosting files for desktop support management (software updates for example).  We use it whenever possible across a number of departments and needs.  It helps us provide IT support to our global workforce without needing an on-premises server and complicated network setup.  It also makes our web hosting cost much less. We use Amazon Web Services in a number of ways across the entire organization.  It addresses the need for flexibility and reactive infrastructure that you cant find in a bare metal environment.  It is also great to POC a new design or product as it is very easy to spin up, scale, and evolve as needed. Our company has exited all of its data centers and migrated the entirety of its workloads into AWS.  We use it across the enterprise and it has allowed us to transform our IT operations and software development.  All of our applications and associated data are running in AWS. We use Amazon Web Services for storing our disaster recovery backups and it has been very affordable and simple to use.  It works very smoothly with our Rubrik backup system.  This has proven to be smooth.  We also use a number of SaaS providers that are using AWS and we have had good successes with those too. We have used Amazon Web Services for the web hosting ofwww. getbeyondlimits. comfor many years.  All our data gets backed on Amazon Web Services.  Amazon Web Services seems to be quite dynamic in its functionality.  You have so many plans to choose from.  The best part is that you only pay for what you use.  Ideally, if more people visit your website, you pay more and that is good for business. We use Amazon Web Services as a cloud service provider for most of our IT requirements.  The ease to set up and run an application on AWS has made it our go-to choice.  It helps avoid the hassle of setting up and managing infrastructure and lets us focus on our application quality.  We leverageS3, EC2 , Elastic BeanStalk, Lambda, CodePipeline, CloudWatchand a lot of other AWS components regularly for our application development and deployment. We use AWS to host our mobile app data and PIM.  We needed to manage CRM data when we launched our mobile app and there were a few options like on-premise or outsourced hosting.  Considering the effort needed to invest in-house equipment as well as potential difficulties to maintain continuity, our choice was Amazon Web Services. We're using AWS primarily for web hosting. We use AWS for our IT infrastructure and Development platform.  AWS is utilized by all departments within our organization.  We have been able to improve IT infrastructure reliability and reduce costs at the same time. Amazon Web Services offers a comprehensive range of cloud services, which we can utilise at a cost-effective price as well as offering the flexibility and scalability to fast-track deployment of server and storage infrastructure for our clients.  We are also able to set up test / Dev environments for testing applications quickly as well as setting up secure cloud disaster recovery (DR) sites with minimal costs. Being part of RND team, we do data analytics at PetaByte scale.  Amazon Web Services helped us to efficiently orchestrate pipeline and perform data analytics on EMR and Sage notebook.  Using Cloudformation and Step functions, we can deploy the pipeline in production reliably without worrying about infrastructure.  Also, Amazon Web Services support team was accommodating while setting up initial infrastructure and troubleshooting any EMR or Spark related issues. We are using Amazon as a cloud service provider.  We are using Amazon across all the departments in the organization.  It has all the services we need, from virtual machines to serverless.  We mostly use serverless, DynamoDB, S3 and virtual machines with virtual private cloud.  So far AWS was really useful.  We haven't faced any issues yet. We use Amazon Web Services as the backbone of our software-as-a-service product.  We use it to host media files for streaming, downloading, etc with our client app.  Our product involves a wide range of media files: images, audio files, video files, documents, etc and some of them are quite large, so we store it all using AWS. We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting almost every imaginable type of application.  We utilize it regularly and company-wide for trying new things as a POC as well as for mature application hosting.  It is very easy for us to spin up new virtual computing environments, as needed, and on demand. We use a hybrid multi-cloud environment where we have multiple cloud vendors that include AWS, Google and Oracle (OCI).  AWS (Amazon Web Services) is being used for the dev/test environment on-demand.  It was earlier used for customer-facing workloads and analytics but was replaced by Google/Oracle. AWS is used in many, but not all, departments within our organization.  Leveraging AWS allows for our company to avoid upfront infrastructure investments and scale to customer demand with a very short ramp time (if any at all).  Using a secure and best practice common cloud infrastructure mitigates much (but not all) of the security and business continuity risks. Amazon Web Services is a very helpful platform because of its attractive interface that allows me to obtain and configure capacity information, with minimal friction, that perfectly suits our company.  Moreover, it helps me to take complete control of my computer resources and helps to reduce the time required to obtain and to boot new servers, as well.  Apart from this, it provides tools to be build-failure resilient applications and to isolate them from common failure scenarios, in a very efficient manner. We currently use Amazon Web Services in multiple parts of our organization.  We use it for the development of our product, QA, Sandbox and UAT scenarios, as well as in our production environment.  AWS allows us to reliably provide our customers with the services we have to offer.  It also allows us to test the latest technologies and make future plans to develop our software to use them. As a managed service provider, we are seeing AWS as a preferred platform by the customers when it comes to moving their existing workload from the on-premise data center to cloud or deploying new applications.  AWS as a leader in the space continues to release new innovative services each year helping customers meet not only security, scalability, and reliability but also to stay ahead in the game by adopting the latest technologies. It is being used by an individual department.  It provides scalability without the need to manage server infrastructure.  It offers versatile services such as data warehousing, machine learning, and performance monitoring.  You also have control of who accesses what feature through identity and access management, as well as audit activity through Cloud Trail.  It is easy to import your data into AWS, so start-up time is quick. AWS is being used by the IT department mainly.  We take advantage of manged VMs, serverless databases, and different services in order to publish our web applications to external and internal users.  It is also used by our analytics department for predictions. AWS addresses operational costs related to on-premise infrastructure; it helps to simplify infrastructure management and in other cases, eliminating infrastructure management. Both within our organization and for clients, we implement several different Amazon Web Services.  We mostly make use of EC2 for hosting private cloud servers/applications, Simple Storage Service (S3) for hosting data in the cloud, both for active use and backup, and S3 Glacier for archiving low-touch data to the cloud.  All of these AWS services allow us to provide on-demand, infinitely expandable cloud services as needed. We use AWS as the infrastructure provider for our entire global operations.  From DNS down to database systems, we are using services powered by AWS. Amazon Web Services serves multiple purposes for our company.  Depending on a clients requirement and budget, we use Amazon Web Services as database storage and for deploying our computing environments.  It is generally used, accessed and managed by the team working on that particular project.  Our company is a data science product based company and we sell products like inventory management tools, discount management, etc to clients. We migrated our transaction processing system from our own hardware in a data center to the AWS cloud.  In addition, we migrated our accounting server as well.  So our whole organization is now using it.  We also migrated our Oracle database server to Amazon RDS and the performance increase was a nice surprise. Our goal as a company is to ensure that our services are efficient and fast to load.  After years of using traditional web hosts, we finally made the switch to Amazon Web Services and we have not looked back.  Our biggest issues with traditional web hosting was the inability to store large amounts of data and the lack of scalability for our different applications.  AWS allows us to run our services more efficiently and without absorbing the high cost of owning servers.  For our business it's really about solving 3 problems:Scaling - The solution should be able to allow us to scale effectively without the hassles of setting up new servers. Cost effective - The solution should allow us to manage our costs effectively so that none of our clients have to pay more for our services. Integration - The solution should integrate well into our development teams coding and not slow them down. Amazon Web Services has done these for us. AWS has completely changed our business, 1000%.  We used to be tied to a server located in our office.  Access was limited and we were constantly crashing, due to software updates or other items.  AWS holds our entire database, which includes over 25 years worth of data.  While not a direct reason, because we made the switch to AWS, we have been able to move to a smaller office space because we are not longer dependent on a space that includes a server closet.  We've saved a considerable amount of money since the switch because we are no longer calling a developer to come in in an emergency situation to fix our server. AWS is used because it was an easy-to-deploy infrastructure solution for our core applications as well as any future applications.  It is easy to provision different resources, connect those resources, and provide a security to them relatively easily.  It addresses the issue of spinning up a quick infrastructure with a customized configuration and still keep early costs very low. AWS is Infrastructure As A Service for us so we can focus on what our core strengths are.  We started with AWS 8 years ago for one of our Strategic Business Units and honestly waited for other competitors to meet or exceed what we received in services from AWS.  While we did shop around, early on, largely for pricing reasons as our consumption increased across our entire organization.  Then Bezos did what he's best at: he responded to market demand with even more elasticity, even greater service levels (for which he is known to be maniacal) and after all of our shopping around, we made a proactive decision to stay!. Before my company changed hands, my department underwent training for AWS.  If you are going to use AWS, I highly recommend taking the training on CBTNuggets, otherwise you will be lost.  The feature that I have used is S3 storage.  It is ridiculously easy to use, and very affordable. Amazon Web Services allows me to create a virtual machine running Linux so that security, availability, elasticity, reliability, and cost factors are all accounted for.  Information Assurance is of top priority, including claims-based authentication, single sign-on, MEAN stack, and secure SSH access with public and private PKI infrastructure to leverage AAA best practices. Being used as end-to-end platform to deliver services to customers.  Using both IaaS and PaaS products.  Deploying infrastructure as code across multiple regions. Amazon Web Services is only used by the video, production and tech teams at my company.  We are a non-denominational mega church with 5 campuses and we use AWS S3 to upload and manage the MP3 recordings of the message from our weekend services.  I have been with this organization for over 4 years and this is one of the few weekly tasks I do that has not changed. Currently, I use AWS for different applications based on client requirements.  I work with digital marketing mobile applications using open-source technologies.  Namely Apache, PHP and MySQL.  Using AWS to create an instant infrastructure from ground-up allows faster innovation in bringing different solutions to the market.  AWS’s pay-as-you-go model allows for a lower upfront investment. Amazon Web Services is being used cross the whole organization.  We have VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) on AWS and send data via Kinesis.  And we provide the solution to customers via a web server in VPC. It is being used to support clients who are using Amazon Web service.  Lot of clients are comfortable on the cloud, including financial institutions.  We have been largely been using it for our marketing clients' requirements.  It has been very convenient to scale and provide the solutions which are meeting today's market demands.  Not sure how the world ran without AWS. We are using AWS S3 for image storage, SNS for push notifications and SQS for background jobs.  It is used in the engineering department only.  We use S3 for all of our images on our website and iOS applications, SNS for iOS push notification management, and SNS for background jobs for timed mailers. I am an independent consultant.  As such, I provide software solutions and consulting services to customers with different needs.  AWS gives me the tools to cover much of their needs, so it is for me a key tool in the performance of my activities, specifically as application server, databases and files through IaaS go. We are using AWS S3 and EC2 to host our customer's campaign website, public videos clips, content management system etc.  S3 is really easy to setup and we don't need to put a lot of effort to maintain it; the bandwidth is virtually unlimited and it is very helpful for video download.  The availability is great, so we don't need to worry about server or storage failure.  Scale up the server in just a few clicks. We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) throughout the organization as the delivery mechanism for our Software-as-a-Service product.  It hosts our web server, databases, web services, transcoding, and storage for the entire delivery and allows us to leverage the global edge servers for content delivery to our users around the world.  It is the platform for our entire product. It is being used by a department and were used for cloud based resources. We keep our clients' server instances running on AWS so they can expand their business easily. I personally use Amazon Web Services, primarily for database storage.  A lot of the services are free or cheap.  I feel as if my data is secure and trust that Amazon Web Services isn't trying to make a huge profit off of me as much as they are trying to provide a service. Amazon Web Services houses and helps us manage our development and production level services.  Amazon Web Services helps us run production level equipment without having to mange the infrastructure ourselves.  We are able to leverage Amazon Web Services in our development and integration life cycles to minimize the cost of equipment and employees, because we don't have to manage the physical hardware.  The virtual infrastructure that we set up also allows us to to provide HIPAA level security to our clients. Amazon Web Services is an extremely powerful, yet flexible platform for developing applications.  We primarily use it to quickly and cost-effectively establish application infrastructure to support our mobile apps. We are using Amazon Web Services in all our new web applications and we are moving all the projects in the company.  Amazon Web Service has allowed to automate the infrastructure of our projects, increase the speed of the development, and scale our software easily with reduced down time.  Amazon Web Services is fundamental in our array of infrastructure solutions, since we host the applications, backups, static files and databases thinking always as architecture of services.  We integrate perfectly our development instances, with a repository, that is connected to Amazon Web Services in order to provide continuous integration and delivery by running automated testings and deploy it to the Amazon Web Services cloud in minutes automatically. Amazon Web Services is being used by the Software Development department.  We use S3 to host videos and thumbnail images for a particular web application.  In the past we've used EC3 to host a Node. js server and RDS services to host a MySQL database. IT at Qualbe uses Amazon Web Services to do software development, perform testing and for production infrastructure supporting web servers, DNS and database applications. SenseAgility uses a 100% cloud based infrastructure based completely within Amazon AWS.  From test environments to corporate email, we were able to find solutions for everything within this offerings package. AWS is the platform that we use to deliver secure, highly-available solutions in the cloud.  We deploy it for the entire company, as well as for our clients. We are using AWS stack as multi geography, multi cluster infrastructure to run data and compute cloud.  We are using EC2, S3, SNS, SQS, ELB and Route53 as a part of our major architectural components.  This infrastructure is connected via continuous integration/delivery pipeline to leverage fast, focused and frequent feature deployments. We create web based software and we always use Amazon as our primary hosting solution.  We deploy to EC2 either using Beanstalk or setting up instances ourselves, host databases on RDB, all our DNS are on Route 53, balance load through AWS balancers, all content on S3, for security seasons for a few clients we used AWS VPC with VPN connection. As the organization transitions from an in-house to SaaS model AWS was procured for hosting certain capabilities.  This early-stage effort has signaled the validity of the transition model for future applications.  Results have reduced inhouse IT expenditures and provided a simplified enterprise connectivity architecture through interface standards and high-performance bus speeds. "}
