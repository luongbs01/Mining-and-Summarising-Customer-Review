User can just share the link of the environment with other team members and then others can start using it. This is very useful when teams are working on multiple versions of the code and issue has occurred on a particular version of the code In this case developer can directly refer that version of the code in skytap and debug the issue. An excellent place for Virtual machines so we can quickly set up  the environments for a number of clients and share across teams like support, developers, QA.

It doesn't lacks and is time reducing. the storage of the same is also upmost. my overall experience was good, skytap is the good company to work, nothing is best then this, am satisfied. Reasonably easy to use - once you get used to their terminology. Running costs can mount up quickly, but had little trouble getting semi-technical people to use it. In our organization, although the average migration to the cloud has always been seen as a desire for time and the complications it represents. They recommended Skytap. We ventured and the process became a fear of reality. Now we have a hybrid that maximizes our resources. All in short times according to the offer presented. The quality of the migration is excellent and with very few inconveniences. Today we continue to grow with your collaboration. Good company to work with - flexible solution. The SkyTap environment is a robust platform that helps us to build and configure demo and training facilities used by our internal technical sales and training teams.  It allows us to create configuration templates that can be reused to replicate setups quickly and efficiently.  The interface is extremely easy to use, while also providing some advanced capabilities to allow flexibility in creating complex setups.  Overall, it has been a good platform.  We did, however, run into some initial roadblocks with performance when complex environments were created.  Latency was quite apparent at the time.  However, the SkyTap support team was extremely helpful in troubleshooting and pinpointing the areas of concern and was resolved in a timely manner."}
