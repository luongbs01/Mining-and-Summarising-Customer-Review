{"name":"Lumen Private Cloud","oneline":"One company for all your needs. Initially, we only used internet-related services. Having the ability to stay with a single company makes support easier on me as an admin and allows smoother integration. Redundant cloud options that are functional. having it prebuilt was nice the time it took was more than we expected. bundled with our other services was nice as we have internet and mpls services with them. We have experienced good performance, speed has been really good. We feel safe and confident in the reliability of access to data stores."}
